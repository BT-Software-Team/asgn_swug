# Results Description

This section explains how to interpret analysis results. Once an analysis reaches **Complete** status, a `results/` directory is available containing all outputs. See [Review Results](../analysis-results/review-results.md) and [Download Results](../analysis-results/download-results.md) for how to access them.

---

## Overview

The primary results are annotated variant calls in `.csv` and `.vcf` format ([Variants](#variants)). These are summarized into per-gene genotypes ([Genotypes Summary](#genotypes-summary)) and then into a per-sample overview ([Sample Summary](#sample-summary)). Both summaries include QC flags and are reported in `.csv` format.

For QC details see [Quality Control](#quality-control). For variant type–specific methods see [Variant Classes](#variant-classes).

## Sample Summary

The highest-level overview of variants per sample. Only variants that pass the **Summarize** filter criteria appear here (see [Panel Filter Configurations](../configuration/panel-filters.md)). Gene entries also apply additional gene-specific rules (Table 4 in the source guide).

## Variant Classes

### SNVs/Indels

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (<50 bp).

**Applicable genes:** CFTR, SMN1/2 (Mix A, D/phased), HBA1/2, HBB, CYP21A2, TNXB, GBA1, F8

**Method:** Reads aligned to GRCh38 and assigned to allele groups via sequence deconvolution are used to call variants with [Clair3](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3). Variants within the same amplicon are phased (indicated with `|`). Variants observed at a group frequency below 0.15 are filtered out. Detection in or adjacent to homopolymers may have reduced sensitivity.

### Copy Number Variants (CNVs)

Copy number changes at the amplicon or gene level.

**Applicable genes:** CFTR (exon-level deletions), SMN1/2, HBA1/2, HBB, CYP21A2, GBA1, TNXB

**Method:** Copy number is inferred from fold-change calculations using calibrated, normalized read counts relative to endogenous control regions. For genes with paralogs (SMN1/2, CYP21A2/A1P, GBA1/P, TNXB/A), sequence deconvolution is used to assign alleles to the correct paralog before copy number calculation.

**Output:** Copy number results appear in the `Amplicon_Copies` column and are reported as SVs in the Genotype column (`0/1` for deletion, `./1` for duplication).

### Structural Variants (SVs)

Larger genomic rearrangements including deletions/insertions >50 bp, inversions, fusions, and microconversions.

**Applicable genes:** All genes in the panel

**Method:** Within-amplicon SVs are detected using [Sniffles2](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles). Full-amplicon SVs (copy number changes) are detected by fold-change analysis. Inversions (F8 introns 1 and 22) are detected using a multi-primer system. Gene fusions and microconversions (CYP21A2/A1P, GBA1/P, TNXB/A) are detected by evaluating paralog-specific variant (PSV) patterns.

**Short Tandem Repeats (STRs):** FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are detected and sized by read-based analysis. AGG interrupts within CGG tracts are also detected and reported.

## Quality Control

All samples undergo QC checks covering read statistics, copy number model confidence, phasing/copy number consistency, and variant-level quality classifications.

- **QC flags** indicate potential issues but do not prevent results from being reported.
- **QC failures (FAIL)** occur when aggregate Mix coverage is insufficient for any analysis to be confidently performed.

QC information is summarized in the Genotypes Summary and Sample Summary, and detailed in the `quality_control/` output files.

**Primary QC output files:**
- `[Analysis Id]/results/quality_control/quality_control.csv` — all entries
- `[Analysis Id]/results/quality_control/quality_control_flagged.csv` — flagged or failing only
- `[Analysis Id]/results/quality_control/quality_control_fail.csv` — failing only
