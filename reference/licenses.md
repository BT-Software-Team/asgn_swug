> **Verification status:** The frontend and .NET service rows below were checked directly against the source repositories on 2026-08-10 and are current as of that date. The pipeline/bioinformatics tools (Nextflow through CyVCF2) and infrastructure components (Docker Engine, Dapr, nginx, PostgreSQL, OpenJDK, apt-family packages) live in repositories not available for direct verification in this pass — confirm these with the pipeline and platform teams before relying on this table for a release.
